# Operating-Systems Project1

Note: Instead of using `perror` for this particular assignment I decided to use
`fprintf()` + `strerr()` just because it is much easier to output the error this
way rather than building a string using `snprintf` and perror. I do understand
that perror uses errnos but I felt `fprintf()` has more customizibility.

To run this program insure you are in the same directory as the Makefile.

run the following.

Note: all execultables will be located in `bin/`

```
make
bin/ass1 -n <some number> -c <some number of characters>
```

I included all the source files for the project for my own reference. to build
them all run the following:
```
make all
bin/ass1
```

This will execute the base file. add a `bin/ass1-q#` to run the version for a
particular question where # is between [4-8]

To view git log history please run `cat .gitlog`
